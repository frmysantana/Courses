This repository is merely meant to document my progress in any courses I may be taking. 

Because I often spend a few days just learning instead of writing original code, gaps in my github activity may emerge. Anyone who sees my activity may thus think that I didn't do anything productive on these days, so I created this repository to show that I am still being productive.

I want to emphasize that the code appearing here was completed through code-a-longs and/or tutorials, so none of it is original.
